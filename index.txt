About me

I'm a Product Owner specializing in FinTech systems, validation architecture, and scalable backend workflows. Currently working at Broadridge Financial Solutions, I lead structured validation systems across index programs, extraction templates, and high-availability workflows.

I focus on transforming operational complexity into modular, production-ready product systems. My work involves close collaboration with engineering, QA, and stakeholders to ensure reliable releases and measurable impact.

Beyond enterprise systems, I build AI-powered productivity tools like FlowPilot and ScreenSage, combining behavioral insights with product design to improve digital clarity and focus.

My long-term goal is to evolve into a product leader driving system-level innovation at scale.
